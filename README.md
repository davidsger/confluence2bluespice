# confluence2bluespice
Migration tool for converting a confluence export to a bluespice import file


# Where from?
In the blog post at the (bluespice webpage)[https://bluespice.com/migration-from-confluence-to-bluespice-mediawiki/] was mentioned that there is a script available to convert the confluence export to a file that can be imported to bluespice. The repository is under (this)[https://github.com/hallowelt/migrate-confluence] link. Since it is a little bit outdated it didn't run on my ubuntu 22.04 so I decided to create a docker container.

# How to run?
